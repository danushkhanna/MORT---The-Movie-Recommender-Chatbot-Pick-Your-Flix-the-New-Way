*Mort - Pick your flix the new way*
Mort is a one-stop-shop bot that delivers the perfect movie recommendation for you. Instead of spending hours sifting through opinions and options, Mort will do the research and find the best movie recommendation for you based on your preferences.

How it works
Using Mort is simple. All you have to do is type in what you feel like watching, and Mort will do the rest. If you don't like what you see, just say so, and Mort will refine the results to match your preferences. Mort uses natural language processing and machine learning to provide you with a human-like experience.

How we've built our bot
Our entire bot is coded in Python, using the Streamlit framework. We've integrated the GPT model from OpenAI to give our bot a more human-like feel. Mort relies on JSON API calls to import synopsis and stats from websites like IMDB.

We developed Mort as a team project, and our team members are:

Danush Khanna
Navansh Khandelwal
Sanyam Jain
Srivaishnavi Yaddanapudi
Installation
To use Mort, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install PyCharm.
Install Anaconda (not Python).
Create a new environment called Chatbot (or any name you prefer) in Anaconda.
Open the .py file using PyCharm.
Install all the imported packages on the first few lines of the code using the pip install method.
To run the code, open the PyCharm terminal and run the code: streamlit run FILENAME.py (replace FILENAME with the name you gave to the environment, making sure you are in that file directory before you run. Use the tab key to find the file/folder.)
The bot will run by opening a new tab on your default browser.
If using Anaconda does not work, you can install Python and use it as an interpreter.

Dependencies
Mort relies on the following Python packages:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
requests
