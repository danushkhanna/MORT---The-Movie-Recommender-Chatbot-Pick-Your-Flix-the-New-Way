# Mort
Pick your flix the new way

What happens when you ask the internet for movie recommendations?
Hundreds of opinions options, none that match what you want. But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.

Mort, the one- stop bot that delivers that one flix you’re looking for.

How It Works:
Just type in what you feel like watching,
Mort will do the rest!
Don’t like what you see? Just say so!

How We’ve Built Our Bot:
• The entire bot is coded in Python, using the Streamlit framework.
• To give our bot a proper human-like feel, we’ve integrated the GPT from openai.
• It relies on JSON API call to import synopsis and stats from websites like IMDB, etc.

How is Mort better?

Everything else:
× No personal recommendations.
× Need to go through a lot of
irrelevant results as well
× Need to rely on multiple sites to get a proper recommendation

While Mort:
Filtered recommendation based on what your needs
Top results only; scans through all the relevant results in the web
The bot does the research

Thank you
