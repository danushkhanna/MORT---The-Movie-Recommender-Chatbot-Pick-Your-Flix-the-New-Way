# **Mort: Pick your Flix the New Way**

Welcome to Mort, the one-stop bot that delivers the movie you're looking for. Mort is a chatbot that recommends the best movies based on your preferences. With Mort, you no longer need to go through irrelevant search results to find a good movie to watch.

# **Getting Started**

Here are the steps to get Mort up and running on your local machine:

- Install PyCharm, an integrated development environment for Python.
- Install Anaconda, a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing.
- Create a new environment called "Chatbot" (or any other name you prefer) in Anaconda.
- Open the .py file using PyCharm.
- Install all the imported dependencies listed on the first few lines of the code using pip install method.
- To run the code, open the PyCharm terminal and run the command:
```
 streamlit run FILENAME.py
```
Make sure you are in the file directory for the Chatbot environment and use the tab key to find the file/folder. The bot will automatically open in a new tab on your default browser.
- If using Anaconda as the Python interpreter does not work, you can install Python and use it as an interpreter.

**Note**:
The code in the repository does not mention the OPENAI API KEY. Therefore, you need to use your own OpenAI API Key to run the code.

# **How to Run the Bot**

Once you've set up the environment and installed the required packages, you can run the bot by following these steps:

- Open PyCharm and open the project containing the bot code.
- Make sure you are in the environment you created earlier (i.e., Chatbot).
- Open a terminal in PyCharm and navigate to the directory where you've saved the bot code.
- Run the command:
```
streamlit run FILENAME.py
```
(replace FILENAME with the name of the file containing the bot code).
- Wait for a few seconds until the bot opens in a new tab on your default browser.

# **Features**

Mort offers several features that make it stand out from other movie recommendation websites and bots:

- Filtered recommendations based on your preferences
